# Hello, my name is EstefanÃ­a GarcÃ­a ðŸ‘‹
### Web Development Student

After having experiences in various sectors, I recently discovered that my place is among computers, which is why I decided to delve into the vast world of programming.

Since I was very young, I have been interested in technology and tinkering with computers. I still remember how an Amstrad CPC 464 caught my attention at the age of 3.

Now I want to redirect my path towards this world, because as they say, it's never too late.

I also have knowledge in Digital Marketing and Social Medias, as I completed the first year of Education in Marketing and Advertising professional certificate.
